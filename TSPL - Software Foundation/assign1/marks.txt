Well done. 5(3/4)
Key: k(m/n)
k points achieved (out of 5)
(m/n) number of stretch exercises completed/attempted.


    Basics (Basics.v):
        factorial			good
        blt_nat				skipped [1]
        blt_nat directly (stretch)	good
        mult_S_1			good
        boolean_functions		good [2]
        andb_eq_orb			good [3]
        binary (stretch) 		good [4]
    Induction (Induction.v):
        basic_induction			good [5]
        mult_comm			good [5]
        beq_nat_refl			good
        binary_commute (stretch)	good
        binary_inverse (stretch) 	skipped
    Lists (Lists.v):
        list_funs			good
        list_exercises			good
        rev_injective (stretch)		attempted [6]
        hd_error			good
        option_elim_hd			good
        update_eq			good
        update_neq 			good

[1] best to try both ways, non-recursive and recursive.

[2] spelling in comment: rewtire -> rewrite!

[3] "unify false and true": misleading. Better "rewrite false to true".

[4] Could use names reminiscent of a string of bits:
    O --> empty (e.g., E)
    B --> add 0 to end of string (e.g., S0)
    M --> add 1 to end of string (e.g., S1)

[5] You sometimes use more cases than necessary.

[6] You tried the hard proof. Easy  proof uses rev_involutive.
