[!] The proof was indeed correct, which is good.
    Still, during the exam make sure everything compiles as it is.


[1] Could prove a stronger condition (by combining hoare_while and hoare_seq):

         {{P}} c {{Q}}  {{Q /\ ~b}} c {{Q}}
        -------------------------------------  (hoare_repeat)
        {{P}} REPEAT c UNTIL b END {{Q /\ b}}
